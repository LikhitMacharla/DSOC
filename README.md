RealOptical is the function for laser communication, Optics_analysis is where you input parameters. 
In optics_analysis I've already split the sections to find the effect on data rate from reciever diamer, sensitivity, atmospheric attenuation and wavelength. Feel free to take the code and test results of other parameters
