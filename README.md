RealOptical is the function for laser communication to find data rates, Optics_analysis is where you input parameters. 
In optics_analysis I've already split the sections to find the effect on data rate from reciever diameter, sensitivity, atmospheric attenuation and wavelength. Feel free to test results of other parameters
